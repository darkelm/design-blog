# Seed Content — Launch Planning

Don't launch empty. The first few pieces define what "good" looks like for everyone who follows.

## Target: 3-5 Pieces Before Launch

### 1. Case Study (Required)

Pick a shipped project with clear before/after. Doesn't need to be your biggest win, but it needs to demonstrate the depth you want.

**Must include:**
- Real constraints you worked within
- Actual decisions and the reasoning behind them
- Honest reflection—what worked, what didn't

**Good candidates:**
- A recent redesign with measurable impact
- A project where you solved an interesting problem
- Something with good visual artifacts to show

**Avoid:**
- Projects still in flight (wait until shipped)
- Work you can't show due to confidentiality (unless you can abstract it)
- Wins without substance ("we made it pretty")

---

### 2. POV / Opinion Piece (Required)

Something your team has a genuine stance on. Healthcare design has plenty of territory.

**Potential topics:**
- Accessibility in clinical contexts
- Designing for users under stress (patients, caregivers)
- Balancing compliance requirements with usability
- The role of design in patient safety
- How your team approaches research in healthcare
- Why healthcare design is different (or isn't)

**Pick something you actually care about.** Readers can tell when an opinion piece is written to fill space versus written from conviction.

### 3. Interview or Team Spotlight (Required)

Humanizes the org. Shows there are interesting people behind the work.

**Options:**
- Design lead talking about building the team and culture
- Senior IC on their craft journey or area of expertise
- Q&A with a researcher about a method or insight
- Conversation with a clinical partner about collaboration

**Keep it substantive.** Not "What's your favorite design tool?" but "What's the hardest design problem you've solved here?"

---

### 4-5. Shorter Pieces (Recommended)

Shows range and makes the site feel active.

**Ideas:**
- Process post: How you run critiques, your design system governance, your research ops
- Tool review: An honest take on something you use daily
- Event recap: A conference, workshop, or internal event worth sharing
- "How we made this": Behind the scenes on a specific deliverable

| Week 2-3 | First drafts due. Begin editorial review. |
| Week 4 | Revisions. Final image assets prepared. |
| Week 5 | Final approval. Load into Ghost as drafts. |
| Week 6 | Soft launch (internal). Fix any issues. |
| Week 7 | Public launch with all seed content live. |

## Quality Over Speed

Don't let "we need to launch with something impressive" stall you. But also don't rush out mediocre content just to have something.

**The bar is:** Good and real, not perfect and polished.

You can always add a marquee case study later. What you can't easily undo is setting a low bar that everyone then matches.

## Post-Launch Cadence

**Target:** 2-4 pieces per month

**Sustainable rhythm:**
- 1 substantial piece (case study, deep POV) per month
- 1-2 shorter pieces (process, tools, events) per month
- Interviews as available (don't force a schedule)

Build a backlog. Always have 2-3 pieces in some stage of progress so you're never scrambling to publish.
