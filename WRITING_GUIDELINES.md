# Writing Guidelines — Design Blog

These guidelines are for anyone writing for the blog: team members, guest authors, and AI agents helping draft content.

---

## Voice & Tone

**We are:**
- Confident but not arrogant
- Specific and concrete
- Honest about challenges
- Generous with knowledge
- Respectful of the reader's time

**We are not:**
- Preachy or self-congratulatory
- Vague or buzzword-heavy
- Defensive or dismissive of other approaches
- Writing to impress rather than inform

**Read it out loud.** If it sounds like marketing copy or a press release, rewrite it. If it sounds like something you'd say to a smart colleague over coffee, you're close.

---

## Structure

### Headlines
- Clear and specific. Say what the piece is about.
- Front-load the value. What will the reader learn or gain?
- Avoid clickbait, questions as headlines, or vague teasers.

**Good:** "How We Reduced Form Errors by 60% with Progressive Disclosure"
**Bad:** "You Won't Believe What Happened When We Redesigned Our Forms"
**Bad:** "Thoughts on Forms"

### Opening
- Get to the point in the first two sentences.
- State the problem, insight, or thesis immediately.
- Don't start with "In today's fast-paced world..." or similar throat-clearing.

### Body
- Use subheadings to help scanning, but don't overdo it.
- One idea per paragraph.
- Show, don't tell. Screenshots, diagrams, examples.
- Include specifics: numbers, timelines, constraints.

### Closing
- Summarize the key takeaway in one sentence.
- Optional: What's next, what we're still figuring out.
- Don't end with a generic call-to-action unless it's genuinely relevant.

## Content Type Guidelines

### Case Studies

**Purpose:** Show how we approached a real problem, made decisions, and what we learned.

**Must include:**
- The problem and context (who, what, why it mattered)
- Constraints we were working within
- Key decisions and the reasoning behind them
- Outcome (with specifics if possible—metrics, user feedback)
- What we'd do differently

**Length:** 1,500–3,000 words
**Visuals:** Process artifacts, before/after, key screens, diagrams

**Honesty matters.** The best case studies acknowledge tradeoffs and mistakes. Readers are skeptical of stories where everything went perfectly.

---

### POV / Opinion

**Purpose:** Share a perspective on design practice, tools, industry trends, or ways of working.

**Must include:**
- A clear thesis stated early
- Supporting arguments or evidence
- Acknowledgment of counterarguments or limitations

**Length:** 800–1,500 words
**Visuals:** Optional, only if they clarify the argument

**Take a stance.** Wishy-washy "it depends" pieces aren't worth publishing. You can be nuanced while still having a point of view.

---

### Process Posts

**Purpose:** Explain how we do something—a method, ritual, or workflow.

**Must include:**
- What the process is and why we use it
- Step-by-step explanation
- Examples from real usage
- When it works and when it doesn't

**Length:** 1,000–2,000 words
**Visuals:** Templates, screenshots, photos of the process in action

---

### Interviews

**Purpose:** Spotlight a person's thinking, experience, or expertise.

**Format:** Q&A or narrative (your choice)
**Length:** 1,200–2,000 words

**Good questions:**
- Ask about specific projects, not general philosophies
- Follow up on interesting answers
- Include questions about challenges and failures, not just wins

**Edit for clarity** but preserve the subject's voice. Don't make everyone sound the same.

---

## Formatting

### Text
- Use **bold** sparingly for emphasis, not for every key term
- Use *italics* for titles of books/films or for introducing terms
- Avoid ALL CAPS
- Use Oxford commas

### Lists
- Use lists for genuinely parallel items
- Don't use lists as a crutch to avoid writing prose
- Keep list items roughly the same length

### Links
- Link to sources, references, and related content
- Use descriptive link text, not "click here"
- External links open in new tab; internal links don't

### Images
- Every image needs alt text
- Captions are optional but helpful for context
- Use consistent aspect ratios within a piece
- Compress images—don't upload 5MB PNGs

## Before You Publish

**Self-review checklist:**

- [ ] Does the headline accurately describe the content?
- [ ] Is the thesis or main point clear in the first paragraph?
- [ ] Have I shown specifics rather than just telling?
- [ ] Is every section earning its place? (Cut anything that doesn't serve the reader)
- [ ] Have I read it aloud to check for awkward phrasing?
- [ ] Are all images properly captioned with alt text?
- [ ] Have I credited collaborators and sources?

**Peer review:**
All posts go through at least one editor before publishing. The editor checks for:
- Clarity and structure
- Tone consistency with the blog
- Factual accuracy
- Anything that might reflect poorly on the team or company

## For Guest Authors

We welcome guest contributions from:
- Industry practitioners with relevant expertise
- Partners and collaborators we've worked with
- Academics researching relevant topics

**Guest post process:**
1. Pitch the topic to the editor (1-2 paragraphs describing the piece)
2. If approved, write a draft following these guidelines
3. Submit for editorial review
4. Revise based on feedback
5. Final approval and scheduling

**We don't publish:**
- Promotional content or product announcements
- Pieces that have been published elsewhere
- Content that requires us to link to specific commercial products

## For AI Agents Helping with Content

When drafting or editing content:

1. **Match the voice.** Read 2-3 existing posts first to calibrate tone.
2. **Prioritize specificity.** Ask for concrete details, numbers, examples.
3. **Flag gaps.** If a section needs information you don't have, note it clearly.
4. **Preserve the author's voice.** When editing, don't homogenize everything.
5. **Check claims.** If something sounds like a statistic or fact, verify or flag it.

When generating from scratch:
- Clearly mark the draft as AI-generated for editor review
- Include [PLACEHOLDER] markers for anything that needs human input
- Don't invent quotes, statistics, or project details
